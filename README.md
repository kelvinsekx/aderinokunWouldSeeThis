## How to use

The use is simple. No framework or need for npm anything. Log the index.html file into a modern browser and volla.

## But
Before the input search works, you would need to use some credentials (personal access token from github).

Ok. All you'll do is to create a token.js file in your root folder. Then paste your token like this.

```javascript
const token = <YOURTOKEN>
```

Now start to search for users on the search input and see them blow up on your screen.

## Attribution
This work is a project thing for a job hunt and all credits go there.
